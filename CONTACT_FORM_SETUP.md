## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### Backend (Server)
1. **`server/server.js`** - Added email endpoint `/api/contact`
2. **`server/.env`** - SMTP configuration (needs your credentials)
3. **`server/package.json`** - Added nodemailer and dotenv dependencies
4. **`server/README.md`** - Detailed setup instructions

### Frontend
1. **`src/components/Contact.tsx`** - Updated with form state management and API integration

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure Email Credentials

1. Open `server/.env` file
2. Update with your email credentials:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=esmarthealthcarehyd@gmail.com
PORT=5000
```

### Step 2: Get Gmail App Password

**Important:** You need an App Password, not your regular Gmail password!

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Select **Mail** and **Windows Computer**
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
7. Paste it in `.env` as `SMTP_PASS`

### Step 3: Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal in the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see: `Server running on port 5000`

### Step 4: Start the Frontend

Open another terminal in the main project directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test the Contact Form

1. Navigate to the Contact page in your browser
2. Fill out all form fields (all are required)
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see:
   - A loading state with "Sending..." text
   - A success toast notification
   - Form fields cleared
   - Admin receives an email with form details
   - User receives a confirmation email

## üìß Email Templates

- Remove spaces from App Password

### "Connection timeout" Error
- Check internet connection
- Verify SMTP settings
- Try port 465 with `secure: true`

### Emails Not Received
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify ADMIN_EMAIL in .env
- Check server console for errors

- Check browser console for details
- Verify API URL in Contact.tsx

## üåê API Endpoint

### POST `/api/contact`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+91 9876543210",
  "subject": "Product Inquiry",
  "message": "I would like to know more about..."
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Your message has been sent successfully! We will get back to you soon."
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message here"
}
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use App Passwords** - Never use your main email password
3. **Rotate passwords regularly** - Change App Password periodically
4. **Use environment variables** - Don't hardcode credentials
5. **Enable 2FA** - Always use 2-Step Verification

## üì± Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

Set these in your hosting platform:

**Netlify:**
- Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables

**Vercel:**
- Project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Heroku:**

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=esmarthealthcarehyd@gmail.com
```

### Update API URL

  // ... rest of the code
});
```
