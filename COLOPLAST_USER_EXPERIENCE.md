## 🔄 Smart Brand Rotation Explained

### Why We Do This
When browsing products, we automatically arrange them so you see different brands in sequence. This:
- **Prevents Fatigue** - Not boring seeing same brand repeatedly
- **Shows Variety** - Easy to compare different options
- **Improves Decisions** - See what's available before committing
- **Better UX** - More engaging browsing experience

### How It Works
```
NORMAL (Without Rotation):
[SenSura] [SenSura] [SenSura] [Alterna] [Alterna]
  ❌ Boring seeing same brand 3 times in a row

WITH SMART ROTATION:
[SenSura] [Alterna] [SenSura Mio] [LC] [Alterna]
  ✅ Different brand each time - more interesting!
```

### When It Applies
- ✅ When browsing all products
- ✅ After applying filters
- ✅ On every page of results
- ✅ Unless you sort by Price or Name (then sorting takes priority)

## 🎯 Finding Products Fast

### The 3-Filter Formula
For best results, use at most 3 filters:

**✅ GOOD:**
```
Filter 1: Brand = SenSura
Filter 2: Bag System = 1-piece
Filter 3: Price Range = ₹2,000-₹3,000
→ Result: 3-5 products
```

**❌ AVOID:**
```
Selecting ALL filters at once
→ Might result in 0 products
```

### What If No Results?
**Solution:** Click "Clear All" and restart with broader filters

```
Too specific? → [Clear All]
           ↓
Less specific → See 20+ products
         ↓
Then apply ONE filter → Narrow down gradually
```
