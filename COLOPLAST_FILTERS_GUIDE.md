## 🔄 Smart Brand Rotation

### How It Works
When browsing filtered results, products are automatically arranged so that the **same brand doesn't appear twice in a row**.

**Example Display:**
```
Page 1:  [Alterna] → [SenSura] → [SenSura Mio] → [Alterna] → [LC] → [SenSura]
         1        2         3             4        5      6

Instead of (confusing):
         [SenSura] → [SenSura] → [SenSura] → [Alterna] → [Alterna]
         1         2         3           4        5
```

### Benefits
✅ Prevents visual fatigue from same-brand repetition
✅ Helps compare different brands easily
✅ Improves browsing experience
✅ Shows product variety
